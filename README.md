Who is the site for?

The site designed for the average person, providing them with accessible information to read, learn and make their own informed decisions. They serve as platforms where individuals can explore a wide range of topics, from news and education to product reviews and personal blogs.

By presenting information in a clear and understandable way, websites empower individuals to gather knowledge, consider different perspectives and form their own opinions or make choices based on their own judgement. Websites act as valuable resources, facilitating the exchange of information, ideas and experiences, ultimately enabling people to make informed decisions that affect their lives.

It is essential that websites prioritise clarity, impartiality and user-friendliness to ensure that readers can easily navigate and understand the content. This approach ensures that individuals can access the information they need, evaluate it critically and come to their own informed conclusions.

In summary, websites serve as important tools for disseminating information and enabling individuals to become well-informed and independent decision-makers. 

HTML for me.

HTML has been a delightful surprise for me! I was first intimidated by its complexities, but as I dug deeper and began playing, I realized its actual natureâ€”simple, intuitive, and simply exhilarating! HTML's fundamental structure and readability impressed me much.

Understanding the function of each heading first appeared to be a difficult challenge. I was continually asking myself, 'What if I did this?' However, through relentless trial and error, I ultimately got a strong understanding of how to use headers efficiently in my code.

It seemed to me that practice and hands-on experience are the ultimate keys to understanding any programming language or markup language, such as HTML. Accepting this method has given me the ability to grow.
